<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"> <h2> <i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> Compound ingredients </h2> <p> If a food contains <button data-accordion-item="comp-ingredient" class="accordion-btn"> compound ingredients </button> that contribute 5% or more to the final food, then all the ingredients and additives in that compound ingredient must be declared. If a food contains a compound ingredient that contributes less than 5% to the final food, then only allergens and food additives require listing. </p> <p> For example: The ingredient list would show the dark chocolate chips in a muffin as: dark chocolate chips [sugar, cocoa mass, cocoa butter, natural vanilla flavour]. </p> </div>
