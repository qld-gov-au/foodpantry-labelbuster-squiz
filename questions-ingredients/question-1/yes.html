<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"> <h2> <i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> Characterising ingredients </h2> <p> Food labels must show the percentage of the characterising ingredients in the food. The Food Standards Code provides details on how <button data-accordion-item="char-ingredient" class="accordion-btn"> characterising ingredients and components </button> should be calculated and shown. </p> <p> For example: The ingredient list would show the strawberries in strawberry jam as: <b>Strawberries (23%).</b> </p> </div>
